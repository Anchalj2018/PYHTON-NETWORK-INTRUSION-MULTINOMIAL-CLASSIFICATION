# PYHTON-NETWORK-INTRUSION-MULTINOMIAL-CLASSIFICATION
The case requires to build network intrusion detection system to detect anomalies and attacks in the network. The data used is KDDCUPâ€™99 data set, which is widely used as one of the few publicly available data sets for network-based anomaly detection systems. For more about data: http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html . The detection of normal activity or attack category is achieved through multinomial classification .
